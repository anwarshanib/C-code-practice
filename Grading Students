//At HackerLand University, a passing grade is any grade 40 points or higher on a 100 point scale. 
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student’s grade according to the following rules:

If the difference between the grade and the next higher multiple of 5 is less than 3, round to the next higher multiple of 5
If the grade is less than 38, don’t bother as it’s still a failing grade
Automate the rounding process then round a list of grades and print the results.
